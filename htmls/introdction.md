## Clean Code

#### Writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code is a skill that is crucial for every developer to master.

Most examples are taken from `Robert J. Martin's book Clean Code`, adapted for PHP.

This is `not a style guide`. It's a guideline to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software in PHP.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally agreed upon.
